# LifeHub

A growing collection of simple, personal productivity mini-apps built with modern web technologies.

LifeHub is a small suite of tools I’m developing to sharpen my full-stack skills while building utilities that I regularly use.
The project is designed as a modular platform where each mini-app lives in its own section, allowing me to iterate, improve, and add new tools over time.

Currently, the first implemented feature is a Weather App, with more apps planned.

### 🌤️ Weather App (v1)

A clean and lightweight weather viewer that displays real-time temperature, conditions, and location-based data.

Features
- Search weather by city
- Displays temperature, conditions, humidity, wind
- Simple and responsive UI
- Built using open weather APIs
- Built to expand into a more advanced dashboard in future updates

🧱 Tech Stack
- LifeHub is being developed using:
- React + Vite (frontend)
- Node.js / Express (planned future backend)
- REST APIs
- Custom UI components
- Modular project structure for expandable mini-apps
- More tools will be integrated as additional apps are added.

📌 Project Goals
- Build a personal toolkit of micro-apps I’ll actively use
- Strengthen full-stack development skills
- Practice clean code, modular design, and component reuse
- Experiment with different APIs and front-end patterns
- Grow the project into a small but polished portfolio piece

📈 Planned Mini-Apps
